## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

I learned that when you start a project you need to follow a schedule and do everything in their order or at the end you will need to chance many things. I mean is better to start a mobile-first approach or put the font-style before adding all other css styles. 

### Continued development

I will train my-self with other project with mobile-first approach, using bootstrap. 

### Useful resources

- (https://getbootstrap.com/) - This helped me for adding style just using HTML class
